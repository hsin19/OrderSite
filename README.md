## How to Use

### Back End (Google Sheets)

_If you are not sure what you are doing, please do not edit when the warning pops out._

There are three main pages:

-   Products: Change product information here, please use url for pictures.
-   Orders: When the order is received on the web, it will be displayed here. In principle, only the status field needs to be changed.
-   Completed Orders: viewing only, List of completed orders.

If you change the status but block the confirmation, you can press the **menu bar > Order Site > Check System** to check again.

### Front End

I think you can use it without instructions!
